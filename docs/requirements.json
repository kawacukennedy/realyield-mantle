    "goal": "Create a secure, composable platform on Mantle Network where verified users can tokenize real-world assets, deposit into yield-bearing vaults, and withdraw earnings using ZK proofs — combining compliance with user privacy.",
    "problem_statement": "Access to compliant DeFi investment products remains fragmented, with high gas costs and opaque custody. Investors and asset issuers lack a scalable on-chain infrastructure for verified, yield-bearing real-world assets (RWA).",
    "solution_overview": "RealYield leverages Mantle's modular architecture to tokenize verified RWA (invoices, real estate, bonds) as NFTs, pool them into ERC-4626 vaults, and distribute yield with ZK-protected, KYC-attested withdrawals.",
    "unique_value": "The first Mantle-native RealFi vault combining ERC-1155 asset tokenization, ERC-4626 vault composability, ZK selective disclosure, and automated compliance enforcement."
